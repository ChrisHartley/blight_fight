As you may know, Renew Indianapolis sells city-owned “landbank”
properties through an application process. As part of that process,
we solicit feedback from the neighborhood organizations that work
in the area where each property is located. If you have any feedback
for our Review Committee or Board of Directors as they consider these
applications please do let us know. Feedback from neighborhood groups
is very important in the decision-making process.

These applications will be considered at the Review Committee meeting
on {% for meeting in application.meeting.all %}{% if forloop.first %}{{meeting.meeting_date}}{% endif %}{% endfor %}.
If they recommend approval the applications will be considered at the
next Board of Directors meeting and finally if they approve at the
following Metropolitan Development Commission meeting, where the final
decision will be made.

Your feedback is welcome at any stage and can be emailed to me to
be passed along.
